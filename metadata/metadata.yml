name: 'COVID-19 Detection on Chest X-Ray Images: A comparison of CNN architectures
  and ensembles'
description: COVID-19 quickly became a global pandemic after only four months of its
  first detection. It is crucial to detect this disease as soon as possible to decrease
  its spread. The use of chest X-ray (CXR) images became an effective screening strategy,
  complementary to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) are often used for automatic image classification and they
  can be very useful in CXR diagnostics. In this paper, 21 different CNN architectures
  are tested and compared in the task of identifying COVID-19 in CXR images. They
  were applied to the COVIDx8B dataset, a large COVID-19 dataset with 16, 352 CXR
  images coming from patients of at least 51 countries. Ensembles of CNNs were also
  employed and they showed better efficacy than individual instances. The best individual
  CNN instance results were achieved by DenseNet169, with an accuracy of 98.15% and
  an F1 score of 98.12%. These were further increased to 99.25% and 99.24%, respectively,
  through an ensemble with five instances of DenseNet169. These results are higher
  than those obtained in recent works using the same dataset.
