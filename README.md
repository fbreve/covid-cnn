Code used for the computer simulations in the paper "COVID-19 Detection on Chest X-Ray Images: A comparison of CNN architectures and ensembles"

If you use this code, please cite the submitted manuscript:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09972

Please build the COVID-Net V8B dataset as described here: 
https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net/blob/master/docs/COVIDx.md
and put it in \data\COVID-Net

The weight files are too large for GitHub. Please download them from this link
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gdlmk9nDUvgDuQ_kwCaPTOKhJJf0ugdb?usp=sharing
and place them inside \data\weights
Notice that the weight files are not required if you want to retrain the networks.

Run code\main.py
